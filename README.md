# Meshtastic-Rugged
Custom Meshtastic Node Designed for Rugged/Tactical Applications. This design is a combination of individual studies and OpenMANET. 

## Infrastructure
The unit is a Raspberry Pi–based MANET (Mobile Ad-Hoc Network) radio built on Wi-Fi HaLow (802.11ah). The goal is to support 802.11s mesh + batman-adv, GPS-driven range testing, and a PTT app, aiming for a rugged, field-ready kit. The project currently targets the Seeed HaLow HAT; support for other devices will be added over time.
